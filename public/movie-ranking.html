<h2>Three movies I loved</h2>

<hr/>

<h3>John Wick</h3>
<p>Directed by Chad Stahelski,<br/> starring Keanu Reeves, Michael Nyqvist, Ian McShane and Willem Dafoe</p>
<p>The pace, the plot, the characterisation, the photography. An action movie like no other. Keanu Reeves is monumental in his portrayal of a retired infamous hitman brought back into service after the death of his wife and attack of his home (let's say it like that to avoid spoilers). The lore is extensive, the character work is splendid, and the plot is gripping. One thing i particularly admire in this movie is the lighting. Most of the action happens at night and in darkly lit places rightly fit for truands. However, you can always perfectly see what's happening. With the advent of Netflix, we are now used to not being able to see anything when a scene happens at night and I think that's a damn shame and filmmakers should watch John Wick back and remember that it's possible to film at night and still see the action. </p>

<h3>Howl's Moving Castle</h3>
<p>Directed by Hayao Miyazaki,<br/>
with the english voices of Emily Mortimer, Jean Simmons, Christian Bale and Josh Hutcherson</p>
<p>My favourite Miyazaki animated film by far. A poetic journey adapted from the eponimous novel by Diana Wynne Jones. If the movie takes a lot of liberties in its adaptation, it is still a beautiful rendition. The characters are endearing and their personalities complex. Howl is a powerful magician, a drama queen and a coward. He is also a kind soul, a mischevious young man and a generous friend. Sophie is a capable young lady, a sharp-tongued old woman, a caring ally and a self-depricating young woman whose journey will help her grown into her own self and realise all her potential. The animation, as is usual with Miyazaki, is stunning and the score of the movie will stay in your head forever. </p>

<h3>Ocean's Eleven</h3>
<p>Directed by Steven Soderbergh,<br/>
starring George Clooney, Matt Damon, Brad Pitt and Andy Garcia</p>
<p>Some would consider it a guilty pleasure, I do not even shy from calling it a favourite. Ocean's Eleven and its marvelous casting is a deeply entertaining movie and one that sparked inspiration for many a later movie. The heist formula is magical. What a treat to follow the action along, only to discover that you'd been looking at it wrong, or at the wrong angle, or that you weren't looking at the right thing at all. What a delight to witness the rewinding of events and the unfolding of the true action. The characters are diverse and lovable, very easy to grow fond of. Siding with this motley crew is incredibly easy and having fun with them makes it all the more difficult when the movie end and it's time to part ways. </p>
